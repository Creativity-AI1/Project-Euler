Project Euler Solutions in Python

This repository contains my personal solutions to various Project Euler problems, written in Python. The purpose of this project is to improve my problem-solving and programming skills through challenging mathematical problems that require efficient algorithmic thinking.

Each solution is saved as a separate Python file in the problems/ directory, named according to the corresponding problem number (e.g., problem_001.py, problem_002.py, etc.). To run any solution, simply open a terminal and execute the desired script using Python 3, for example: python problems/problem_001.py.

This is a personal learning project, but if you find something useful or want to contribute improvements or alternative approaches, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you to Project Euler for providing such a stimulating and educational set of challenges.
